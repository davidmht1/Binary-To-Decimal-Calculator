# Binary-To-Decimal-Calculator
A binary to decimal calculator with some extra methods. 


Program asks user to input a binary number. If the number is not a valid binary number the program asks the user to try again. Once a valid binary number is inputed the program then converts the binary number to a decimal value.
Program will also display if the now converted decimal number is divisible by 3, or 5, or both, or neither.
The decimal number is also displayed backwards and the sum of each individual number that makes up the now converted number is displayed(ex: 1 2 3 = 6)
